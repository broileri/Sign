# TO DO
- Tweak score multipliers by difficulty (maybe add combo multipliers etc. too?)
- Start and stop to have a natural start and end to game? 
- ...and the game shouldn't start immediately after pressing "start", so that the user has time to move away from the keyboard to consume plankton
- Lives?
- Make it look beautiful/interesting/game-like
- Combining the UI with LM, lol- 


# Also, maybe add...
- High scores?
- Sound effects?
- Option to enable/disable cheatsheet on every difficulty? 
- show the selected difficulty somewhere, somehow
