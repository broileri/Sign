# TO DO
- Tweak score multipliers by difficulty (maybe add combo multipliers etc. too?)
- some kind of "you lose" message, preferably with a pic (of a sad frog http://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/frog.html ?)
- the game shouldn't start immediately after pressing "start", so that the user has time to move away from the keyboard to consume plankton
- Make it look beautiful/interesting/game-like
- Combining the UI with LM, lol

# Also, maybe add...
- High scores?
- Sound effects?
- Option to enable/disable cheatsheet on every difficulty? 


# Done
- show the selected difficulty somewhere, somehow
- Lives
- Start and stop to have a natural start and end to game?
